Use this helper to test that the [Summary list component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/) is visible on the page with the correct content, for example on a Check your answers page.


Add this code:

```ruby
  expect(html).to summarise(
    key: "Name",
    value: "Sarah Philips",
    action: {
      text: "Change name",
      href: "/name"
    }
  )
  expect(html).to summarise(
    key: "Date of birth",
    value: "5 January 1978",
    action: {
      text: "Change date of birth",
      href: "/dob"
    }
  )
```

This will test that:

* the keys and values are present, and in the same row as each other
* the action links are present, and link to the pages specified

If you donâ€™t have any change links, those can be dropped:

```ruby
  expect(html).to summarise(
    key: "Name",
    value: "Sarah Philips"
  )
  expect(html).to summarise(
    key: "Date of birth",
    value: "5 January 1978"
  )
```
